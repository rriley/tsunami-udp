Tsunami-UDP
===========
From http://tsunami-udp.sourceforge.net/

Tsunami UDP Protocol: A fast user-space file transfer protocol that uses TCP
control and UDP data for transfer over very high speed long distance networks
(≥ 1 Gbps and even 10 GE), designed to provide more throughput than possible
with TCP over the same networks. The project is based on original Indiana
University 2002 Tsunami source code, but has been significantly improved and
extended. As such, large portions of the program today are courtesy by Aalto
University Metsähovi Radio Observatory.

Includes FTP-like client and server command line applications for normal file
transfers. It has additionally been extended for high rate real-time data
streaming in eVLBI radio astronomy and geodesy (VSIB, PCEVN DAQ). Licensed
under the original IU open source license. 

This repository on GitHub is not affiliated with the original project at all.
I just use tsunami for doing some file transfers across a high bandwidth
high latency link, and thought that my minor modifications to organize and
compile the code could be useful to someone somewhere.

More Documentation
==================
See the docs/ directory for all of the original documentation that came with
the code.

Compiling
=========
You need automake and autoconf installed.  This can usually be accomplished
with your favorite package manager.  I type:

apt-get install automake autoconf

From there, just run ./recompile.sh to get a compile started.
