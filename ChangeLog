v1.1 CvsBuild 19:
 - client, cleaned up the GET * code a lot, file list can contain up 
   to 65530 files (although, as 'tsunamid' currently gets * files as 
   command line arguments, the maximum argument length is the current limit)

V1.1 CvsBuild 18:
 - client, replaced 'set noretransmit' option with 'lossless' (yes/no) and 
   'losswindow' (milliseconds) options to allow for near-time lossless transmissions 
   e.g. from limited VSIB memory buffer
 - reduced client ring buffer size from 8192 to 4096

V1.1 CvsBuild 17:
 - realtime server, removed extra delay before sending newly read VSIB block

V1.1 CvsBuild 16:
 - client, added 'set passphrase' option so the user is not prompted for the password, this
   is used for e.g. scripting (of course, plaintext password in scripts then)
	
V1.1 CvsBuild 15:
 - client, "get *", if the server sends full path names, place files in that same path
   on client side if the path exists, otherwise place in current working directory
