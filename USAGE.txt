 Very Quick Guide
 ================

 --Server--

 On the server, go to the directory where you
 have the files that should be served, and
 start the daemon with e.g.:
    cd /where/my/files/are
    /usr/src/cvs/tsunami-udp/server/tsunamid
 or
    cd /where/my/files/are
    tsunami

 The server serves files from its current
 working directory.


 --Client--

 On the client, start the command line client: 
    cd /where/to/receive/files
    /usr/src/cvs/tsunami-udp/client/tsunami
 or
    cd /where/to/receive/files
    tsunami

 The client will store downloaded files into
 the current working directory.

 Usual commands in the client are like crude FTP:
   connect server.domain.com
   get filename

 Old tsunami server versions will as for a password.
 The default password is 'kitten'.


 The source code documents the rest ;-))


 Not So Quick Guide
 ==================

 Typical usage example where PC1 is the server and PC2 the client.

 Preparations on PC1:

 pc1$ cd /home/guest/outfiles/
 pc1$ cp /usr/src/cvs/tsunami-udp/server/tsunamid .
 pc1$ ./tsunamid

 Connecting from PC2:

 pc2$ cd /home/guest/infiles/
 pc2$ cp /usr/src/cvs/tsunami-udp/client/tsunami .
 pc2$ ./tsunami
   tsunami> set rate 512M
   rate = 512000000

   tsunami> connect myserver.domain.com
   Connected.

   tsunami> get nameoffile
   00     00      00      368      499     15.59   354.7    0.0       499    0.0   354.7    0.0       0  1      354.7
   ...

 Alternative way of connecting from PC2:
  - all commands you'd enter into tsunami's own command line you
  may also concatenate onto the console command line, i.e.:

 pc2$ cd /home/guest/infiles/
 pc2$ cp /usr/src/cvs/tsunami-udp/client/tsunami .
 pc2$ ./tsunami set rate 512M connect myserver.domain.com get nameoffile
   tsunami>
   00     00      00      368      499     15.59   354.7    0.0       499    0.0   354.7    0.0       0  1      354.7
   ...
   ...


 Getting Help
 ============

 Server application, to get a list of command line options use:
   ./tsunamid --help
 
 Client application, to get a list of options use:
   ./tsunami
   tsunami> help
 And to see the current settings in the client (not persistent
 i.e. not stored between program restarts), use:
   tsunami> set

 Settings in the client can be changed using the "set" command
 which has the format:
   set [option] [value]

 Finally, look at the source code.

 In really bad cases you can also use the sourceforge project site
   http://sourceforge.net/projects/tsunami-udp
 to add a support request or send an email to the developer(s).


 Realtime Tsunami Notes
 ======================
 
 The realtime version of the tsunami applications uses the 
 Metsähovi VSIB card.

 --VSIB driver--

 You'll need a post-01/2006 version of the vsib.c driver.
 Tsunami tries to access the VSIB card via /dev/vsib.

 --Realtime Server--

 The realtime server will read data from the VSIB card and send
 the data over the network. 

 Recording mode is hard-coded in the source code, 
 see 
   ./rtserver/vsibctl.c
   int vsib_mode = ...
 and the docs/modes.txt file found in the VSIB source code that
 is available separately from Metsähovi.

 The file name specified by the client in the "get" command
 tells the realtime server when to start recording. If the
 name is an UTC format time/date string, this will be used
 as the starting time. Otherwise, recording starts immediately
 on the next 1 second rollover.
 
 --Realtime Client--

 The realtime client will write back data from the network
 to the VSIB card, i.e. is in "playback" mode. Again, the 
 playback mode is hard-coded but now in
   ./rtclient/vsibctl.c

 To transfer a file from memory/VSIB-in to disk, use
    pc1$ ./rtserver/tsunamid
    pc2$ ./client/tsunami

 To transfer a file from disk to VSIB-out, use:
    pc1$ ./server/tsunamid
    pc2$ ./rtclient/tsunami

 To transfer a file from VSIB-in to VSIB-out, use
    pc1$ ./rtserver/tsunamid
    pc2$ ./rtclient/tsunami
    (this is not fully tested yet)


 Troubleshooting
 ===============

 If no data goes through over the connection, check that
 no firewalls are blocking the default TCP and UDP port 46224.
 This can also be tested using the 'netcat' (or 'nc') linux/unix
 command line tool.
   pc1$ netcat -u -l -p 46224 
   pc2$ netcat -u pc1.domain.com 46224
 and typing in something into pc2 and hitting <enter> should
 then appear on the pc1 as netcat output, unless there are
 firewall problems.

 Another possibility is MTU mismatch and no path MTU discovery.
 Tsunami uses a default block size of 32768 bytes. In the 
 client you could change this to below 10 Mbit LAN MTU using
 the client console command 
   tsunami>  set blocksize 1430
 and then reattempt the transfer (commands: connect, get). If
 this works, then you or your ISP need to fix the network MTU.
